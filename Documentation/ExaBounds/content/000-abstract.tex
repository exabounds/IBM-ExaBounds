\section*{Abstract}

This manual describes how to use IBM ExaBounds for performance and power modeling. ExaBounds is implemented in Mathematica and requires a Mathematica license to be used. There is a GUI available to use IBM ExaBounds, but it is also possible to use the Mathematica language to create scripts for automation of design-space exploration experiments. The current GUI can be used for the processor performance models. For the network performance models, IBM ExaBounds provides the user with an
API that can be used to create Mathematica scripts.
